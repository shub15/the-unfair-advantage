# Product Requirements Document: Standardized Business Input Processing

## Overview
This PRD outlines the requirements for developing a system that standardizes business inputs from entrepreneurs' images/sketches into structured business plans and facilitates evaluation by mentors and admins. This system will be integrated into the Tata Strive workflow at the Application & Assessment stage.

## Problem Statement
Many aspiring entrepreneurs, particularly those from underserved communities, have business ideas but struggle to articulate them in standard business planning formats. They often express these ideas through drawings, sketches, or verbal explanations. The current application process requires formal business documentation, creating a barrier to entry. We need a system that bridges this gap by converting visual and verbal inputs into structured business plans that can be consistently evaluated.

## User Personas

### 1. Entrepreneur (End User)
- Has a business idea but limited formal business planning knowledge
- May prefer expressing ideas visually or verbally
- Needs guidance in structuring their business concept
- Seeks funding and mentorship

### 2. Mentor
- Evaluates business plans for viability and potential
- Provides feedback and guidance to entrepreneurs
- Needs standardized information to make fair assessments
- Has limited time to review each application

### 3. Admin
- Manages the overall application and assessment process
- Tracks application status and metrics
- Needs standardized data for reporting and analysis
- Responsible for matching entrepreneurs with appropriate mentors

## Requirements

### Input Standardization System

#### Image/Sketch Processing
1. **Input Capture**
   - System must accept images of hand-drawn business plans/sketches
   - Support for multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, PDF)
   - Mobile-friendly capture interface with guidance for optimal image quality
   - Option for voice recording to supplement visual information

2. **Image Processing**
   - OCR capability to extract text from images
   - Image recognition to identify business elements (product sketches, flowcharts, etc.)
   - Visual structure analysis to understand relationships between elements

3. **Voice Input Processing**
   - Speech-to-text conversion for verbal explanations
   - Natural language processing to extract business-relevant information
   - Integration with image data to create comprehensive input

### Data Extraction & Standardization

1. **Business Plan JSON Schema**
   - Extraction of minimum viable business plan elements:
     - Business concept/description
     - Target market
     - Revenue model
     - Key resources required
     - Estimated startup costs
     - Competition analysis
     - Unique selling proposition

2. **AI Processing Pipeline**
   - LLM (Gemini API) integration for content analysis
   - Structured data extraction from unstructured inputs
   - Identification of missing critical business information
   - Prompts for additional information when critical elements are missing

### Evaluation System

1. **Automated Assessment**
   - Algorithmic scoring of business plans on a 10-point scale
   - Evaluation criteria:
     - Market potential (0-2 points)
     - Business model clarity (0-2 points)
     - Financial feasibility (0-2 points)
     - Competitive advantage (0-2 points)
     - Entrepreneur capability/commitment (0-2 points)

2. **Eligibility Screening**
   - Automated checking against program eligibility criteria
   - Flagging of applications that meet minimum thresholds
   - Identification of high-potential outliers that may not fit standard criteria

### Standardized Output Generation

1. **Mentor-Ready Business Case**
   - Generation of structured document from standardized data
   - Visual presentation of key business elements
   - Highlighting of strengths and potential areas of concern
   - Comparison with similar businesses in the database

2. **Stakeholder-Specific Views**
   - Entrepreneur View: Structured business plan with guidance for improvement
   - Mentor View: Evaluation-focused presentation with assessment tools
   - Admin View: Application overview with metrics and status tracking

## User Flows

### Entrepreneur Flow
1. Entrepreneur accesses application portal
2. Uploads images/sketches of business idea and/or records voice explanation
3. System processes inputs and generates draft business plan
4. Entrepreneur reviews and confirms/edits extracted information
5. System generates standardized business plan and preliminary score
6. Entrepreneur submits finalized application

### Mentor Flow
1. Mentor logs into evaluation portal
2. Views queue of assigned applications with preliminary scores
3. Selects application to review
4. Views standardized business case with extracted key elements
5. Provides assessment and feedback through structured form
6. Submits evaluation and recommendation

### Admin Flow
1. Admin accesses management dashboard
2. Views overview of applications with status and scores
3. Can filter/sort applications by various criteria
4. Reviews automated assessments and mentor evaluations
5. Makes final decisions on applications
6. Generates reports and analytics on application cohorts

## Technical Requirements

1. **Integration Points**
   - Integration with Tata Strive application workflow
   - API connections to Gemini for AI processing
   - Image processing and OCR services
   - Voice-to-text processing service

2. **Data Schema**
